**vscode-llm-file-companion** is a Visual Studio Code extension that simplifies aggregating file contents into a single document for use with large language models (LLMs). It collects text-based files (like `.py`, `.md`, `.js`, `.html`, `.java`, etc.) along with metadata from your workspace and appends them into an `LLM_doc.txt` file. The extension automatically skips binary or non-readable files.
