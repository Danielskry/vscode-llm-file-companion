# vscode-llm-file-companion

vscode-llm-file-companion is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to effortlessly append file contents into a single document, making it easy to aggregate context for feeding into large language models (LLMs). It allows you to collect text-based files (like `.py`, `.md`, `.js`, `.html`, `.java`, etc.) with metadata from your workspace and append them into an `LLM_doc.txt` file for documentation, processing, or further manipulation in LLMs. The extension skips binary or non-readable files.

## Features
    - **Append Files to LLM Document:** Select files or directories and append readable text-based files into a single document (`LLM_doc.txt`).
    - **Skip Non-Readable/Binary Files:** Automatically skips files that are binary or contain non-printable characters.
    - **Support for Multiple File Types:** Supports `.py`, `.md`, `.js`, `.html`, `.java`, and other text-based file formats.
    - **Workspace Integration:** Works directly within your VS Code workspace, appending files from any folder within the workspace.
    - **Automatic Creation of `LLM_doc.txt`:** If the LLM_doc.txt file doesnâ€™t already exist, it will be created automatically at root.

## Example Workflow:
    - Right-click on a file or directory within your workspace.
    - Choose "Append File to LLM Doc" from the context menu.
    - The contents of readable files are appended into a new or existing `LLM_doc.txt` file.

## Requirements
    - **VS Code 1.50+:** This extension is designed to work with recent versions of Visual Studio Code.
    - **Workspace/Folders:** A workspace must be open in VS Code to use the extension.
